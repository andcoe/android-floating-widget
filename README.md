# Android floating widget

This is a floating widget library that can be used to display an icon over apps (it's a simpler version of Messenger's chat heads).

Current functionality includes:
* Use the widget when the app in on foreground or background
* Drag the floating widget around
* Click detection (which can be used to trigger functionality)
